## Problem Statement

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an m x n integer matrix matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.
 

Example 1:


Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 5
Output: true
Example 2:


Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 20
Output: false
 

Constraints:

m == matrix.length
n == matrix[i].length
1 <= n, m <= 300
-109 <= matrix[i][j] <= 109
All the integers in each row are sorted in ascending order.
All the integers in each column are sorted in ascending order.
-109 <= target <= 109

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]], target: int) -> bool:
        r = 0
        c = len(matrix[0]) - 1
        while r < len(matrix) and c >= 0:
            if matrix[r][c] == target:
                return True
            elif matrix[r][c] > target:
                c -= 1
            else:
                r += 1
        return False
```

## Notes

- Start from top on right, if target < current, move left else move down. Repeat until to find target
- mlogn solution: using bianry search each row
- Time complexity: O(n+m)
- Space complexity: O(1)
